    "## Project proposal Pitch\n",
    "\n",
    "I am proposing an autonomous ornithopter as a longterm project in RMI \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ornithopter???\n",
    "\n",
    "An ornithopter is in simplest terms a mechanical bird that flies by flapping it's wings contrary to that of an aeroplane or a quadcopter \n",

    "\n",
    "### What inspired an Ornithopter\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to work on applying reinforcement learning on a robot and also have wanted to work on aerial robotics.\n",
    "for a while i thought of working on the Drone but one day I came across this video\n",
    "\n",
    "[![patapata](http://img.youtube.com/vi/zH61W-Dcf0k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH61W-Dcf0k \"Ornithopter\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons for me not choosing the drone as my project instead of working on the drone \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does it work\n",
    "\n",
    "the flapping mechanism will be actuated by a single BLDC motor and there will be a gearbox for the necessary reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "![gear box](images/gear_box.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "there are several other mechanisms but this is the one currently in my mind but I have'nt done the math regarding the gearbox so I don't know how good this is but this was the most commonly used one I found\n",
    "\n",
    "![gear2](images/mech.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we actually control the ornithopter\n",
    "\n",
    "I plan on using a Raspberry pi zero with ubuntu core and ros\n",
    "\n",
    "![raspi_0_w](images/rasp_0_w.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "it is a smaller and cheaper raspberry_pi but still has wifi capabilities and can run ros\n",
    "\n",
    "![0_vs_pi](images/pi_0vs.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "then I will interface an atmega328p(**NOT YET FINAL** could be any ucontroller) ic with the pi_0 to output 3 pwm \n",
    "\n",
    "there will be a pan and tilt mechanism at the tail end to control the roll and pitch of the ornithopter \n",
    "\n",
    "The final bot will look a lot like this\n",

    "\n",
    "when the application requires high maneuverability and efficiency\n",

    "* surveilance applications like navigating inside a forest \n",
